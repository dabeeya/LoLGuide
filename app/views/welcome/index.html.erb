      CURRENTLY IN PROCESS <br>
      Homepage will include: miscallenous stuff (like youtube videos and such)<br>
      header with champion guides for champselect, search for a specific player and topic/discussion threads<br>
      find cool background and icon and pictures<br>
      maybe use bootstrap (SASS)?<br>
      Although this site is primarily being made for LoL, hopefully after completetion I will have time to add more games<br>
